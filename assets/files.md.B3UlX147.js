The file matrix provides an overview of the files in the pull request, while the individual file areas show diffs and line-specific discussions.</p><h2 id="revision-cells" tabindex="-1">Revision cells <a class="header-anchor" href="#revision-cells" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Revision cells&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A file&#39;s evolution over the course of the pull request is summarized in both the file matrix and the file areas by a row of revision cells. Each cell represents one revision, with the leftmost ⊥ cell being a virtual base revision that changes to match the right diff bound. Colors and icons in the revision cells summarize what happened in the pull request at each revision, as well as the latest review marks.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="reviewable file matrix status"></p><p>The brackets in a row are the current left and right diff bounds for the file. To adjust the diff bounds, click on one desired revision bound and drag to the other one. You can also just click on a revision to adjust the nearest bound.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="reviewable file matrix diff bounds"></p><h2 id="mark-reviewed" tabindex="-1">Mark as reviewed <a class="header-anchor" href="#mark-reviewed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mark as reviewed {#mark-reviewed}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of Reviewable&#39;s core features is letting you track the reviewed state of each file at each revision, for each reviewer. This enables you to easily remember — and indicate to others — where you left off in the review and easily view only subsequent changes. Marking a file as reviewed doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you think it&#39;s ready for merging, but rather only that you reviewed it at the given revision and added all your comments.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="reviewable fill diffs mark file as reviewed"></p><p>The small button to the left of the file path indicates your current reviewed state for the file at the right diff bound and lets you change it. Typically, as a reviewer, the button will be red to indicate that you need to review this diff, and will turn green when clicked to indicate that you&#39;ve marked the file as reviewed. There are other less common states as well:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;">Color</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+l+'" alt="reviewable file matrix current state" title=":size=25"></td><td>The file has not yet been reviewed at or after the right diff bound.

The two may not always agree: for example, a file may need your overall review but not at your current diff bounds, or a file may have been sufficiently reviewed but you set your <a href="./reviews#file-review-type">review overlap strategy</a> to personally review all files.</p><p>The various possible states are:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;">State</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="red designation you icon"></i> </td><td>Your review of this file has been requested, either directly or due to team membership, and you have not yet reviewed it at the latest revision.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="red designation anyone icon"></i> </td><td>Anyone is welcome to review this file, including you.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="designation anyone icon"></i> </td><td>Anyone is welcome to review this file, but you&#39;ve either already done so or are not a reviewer.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="green designation anyone icon"></i> </td><td>Anyone will be welcome to review this file after you&#39;ve published your review.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="designation others icon"></i> </td><td>Specific other people have been requested to review this file, but you either already did so or your review was not requested.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="green designation others icon"></i> </td><td>Specific other people will still need to review this file after you&#39;ve published your review.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="designation done icon"></i> </td><td>The file has been sufficiently reviewed.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="green designation done icon"></i> </td><td>The file will be sufficiently reviewed once you&#39;ve published your review.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Clicking on the state icon will reveal all the details about a file&#39;s current review state: who needs to review it and why, who has already reviewed it, and (when relevant) who reviewed it at revisions prior to the latest one.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="file review state details"></p><p>By default, Reviewable can only tell who has reviewed a file and infer some basic information about who should review it from a <code>CODEOWNERS</code> file, if present.

If a file is binary or isn&#39;t currently diffed no delta stats will be shown. The total of all displayed delta stats is displayed overhead, in the lower-right corner of the Changes summary.</p><p>Files can also be grouped, like for the <strong>Tests</strong> group in the screenshot above. You can use this to reorder the file list somewhat (groups are listed alphabetically), and to enable marking a subset of files as reviewed with one click. Reviewable will automatically group some files for you, such as files that were only renamed, that appear in a vendored directory, or that were reverted back out of the pull request. See the section on <a href="./repositories#condition-output">custom review completion conditions</a> for instructions on how to make custom file groups in your repository.</p><h3 id="column-headings" tabindex="-1">Column headings <a class="header-anchor" href="#column-headings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Column headings&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Each column in the matrix represents a single revision of each of the files in the review.

When successful, this enables Reviewable to suggest minimum-delta revision pairs for diffing in the “review each commit” style even if you reordered the commits. Arcs that link blocks of revisions above the file matrix show a high-level overview of this mapping.

However, when using heuristics, Reviewable will sometimes &quot;force&quot; a revision when it otherwise wouldn&#39;t to prevent you from missing a critical diff.

This is necessary, for example, if you&#39;re maintaining a fork and rebasing from the upstream master. In such cases, both GitHub and Reviewable will choose the wrong base commit to compare files, and display not only all of the upstream changes—but also all the extra changes made in your fork over time.</p><p>To get the diff that you want, add a <code>Merge manually by overwriting target</code> label (exact spelling!) to your PR. This will cause Reviewable to compare files against the current head of the target branch. Now, you&#39;ll see upstream changes and any conflicts you resolved during the rebase, while leaving out modifications in your fork that survived unscathed.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>For best results, add the label to the PR when you first create it.</p></div>',127)]))}const F=t(Y,[["render",D]]);export{U as __pageData,F as default};
