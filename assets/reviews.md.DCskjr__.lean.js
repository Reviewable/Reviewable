review&quot;">​</a></h1><p>In Reviewable, each review corresponds to a GitHub pull request. To initiate a code review, you’ll first need to create a pull request as usual and then access the corresponding review. This can be done either (a) through the link to Reviewable inserted into the PR, or (b) by clicking on the PR on your Reviewable dashboard.</p><p>In general, Reviewable keeps data synchronized between the review and its pull request for all compatible features, such as assignees, comments, and approvals. However, some features are unique to Reviewable (such as file review marks or discussion dispositions). Other Reviewable features cannot be mapped effectively due to GitHub API limitations, such as line comments that often become top level comments. Consequently, we don’t recommend mixing use of Reviewable and GitHub reviews on the same pull request as the experience will prove frustrating on both sides.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Reviewable can&#39;t operate directly on raw commits, since it doesn&#39;t actually clone your repo.

Reviewable automatically assigns one of three roles to every review participant:</p><ul><li><strong>Author</strong>: the creator of the pull request. Note if an author marks a file as reviewed they&#39;ll become a reviewer.</li><li><strong>Reviewer</strong>: anybody that is not an author or mentionee.</li><li><strong>Mentionee</strong>: someone other than the author that was @-mentioned in a discussion (except the main top-level one). Note that a mentionee will become a reviewer if they start a new discussion or mark a file as reviewed.</li></ul><p>It&#39;s possible for one person to be both the author and a reviewer in a “self-review” scenario. In that case, the “reviewer” behavior usually trumps the “author” path, but it&#39;s context-dependent.</p><h2 id="publish" tabindex="-1">Publishing your review <a class="header-anchor" href="#publish" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publishing your review {#publish}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As you work through a review using the tools at your disposal, Reviewable will automatically save your changes but they won&#39;t be visible to others.

This action will reveal all of these to other authorized Reviewable users, and also post a single, combined message to the PR on GitHub.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>To temporarily keep a draft from being published, switch its disposition to <strong><i class="pondering disposition icon"></i> Pondering</strong>.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>If you&#39;d like to suppress posting the combined message to Github, e.g. because you want to separate the Reviewable review from the GitHub review process, you can do so on a PR-by-PR basis.
