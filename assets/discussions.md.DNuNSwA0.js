Typically, you would begin a top-level discussion if you want to have a distinct file-independent thread in which you can track the disposition of participants and an eventual resolution.

This only works well, however, if you leave all the separators and comment links in place so be sure not to mangle a quoted message too much in your reply. Quoted chunks will be shown in Reviewable if they are woven into your reply, but omitted otherwise (whether the message is top- or bottom-quoted). Any parts of the message that can&#39;t be conclusively tied to a specific discussion will show up in a top-level comment instead.</p><p>Reviewable recognizes a number of case-insensitive shorthands in external comments. You can reply with the single word <strong>acknowledge</strong> (or <strong>ack</strong>) to simulate clicking the primary button in Reviewable (whatever its label might actually be).
