Each comment thread, whether it’s about the whole review or a single line of code, is called a <strong>discussion</strong>. As discussions progress, participants may indicate their stance towards a resolution — whether they’re working on a related task, happy with the discussion&#39;s outcome, or simply adding context. These stances are called <strong>dispositions</strong>. Once everyone’s on the same page about the outcome, the discussion is considered resolved.</p><p>Discussions stay visible until everyone involved reaches an agreement and marks them resolved. This state is independent of any file changes that might happen in the PR; even if the code changes, the discussion remains in place until it’s explicitly resolved.</p><p>A discussion can also be marked as unreplied for specific users — meaning someone still needs to respond — which is separate from whether the discussion itself is resolved.</p><p>Each comment in a discussion indicates its author via an avatar, which you can hover over for more details. You can use your browser&#39;s &quot;find in page&quot; feature (<code>⌘-f</code> or <code>ctrl-f</code>) to search through all comments for all instances of the author’s name or username. This technique will work even though the names and usernames aren’t actually visible on the page.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>When you publish a review, any draft comments in discussions — along with disposition changes or pending acknowledgements — are published too.

File-wide discussions can be started by clicking the file name and selecting <strong>Start a new discussion</strong> from the dropdown.</p><p>For discussions that aren’t tied to a specific file, click <strong>Start a new discussion</strong> at the bottom of the <strong><i class="discussions icon"></i> Top level discussions</strong> panel (below the diffs panel). Start a top-level discussion when you want to create a separate, file-independent thread to track participants’ dispositions (such as <strong><i class="blocking disposition icon"></i> Blocking</strong> or <strong><i class="satisfied disposition icon"></i> Satisfied</strong>) and the eventual resolution. You can also use it to branch off a topic that deserves its own focused thread.</p><h2 id="replying-to-a-discussion" tabindex="-1">Replying to a discussion <a class="header-anchor" href="#replying-to-a-discussion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Replying to a discussion&quot;">​</a></h2><p>At the bottom of each discussion box you can write a comment to add to the discussion.

You can also switch to the <strong>Preview</strong> tab at any time to check how your comment will be rendered.</p><p><img src="'+n+`" alt="reviewable send messages immediately" width="620"></p><p>You can add images and videos to your comment by clicking the upload button <i class="upload cover icon"></i>, by dragging an image onto the draft, or by pasting an image from your clipboard (in some browsers). <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, and <strong>GIF</strong> formats are also supported, with a maximum upload size of 100MB. Other file types such as documents, CSVs, or binaries, are not supported.</p><p>If desired, you can delete your draft by clicking the small trash icon <i class="delete draft icon"></i>. The trashed draft is retrievable by creating another comment in the same spot.</p><p><strong>Sending messages immediately:</strong> Click the <i class="send icon"></i> button to immediately post the comment on the pull request. This won&#39;t publish any other draft comments, which is useful when a large review is in progress and you need to send out a quick clarification or request. Since each recipient will receive an alert for each message sent this way (as configured by default in GitHub), it is usually better to write all of your comments first and then <a href="./reviews#publish">publish</a> them together.</p><h3 id="inline-directives" tabindex="-1">Inline directives <a class="header-anchor" href="#inline-directives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Inline directives&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You can add inline directives in any comment to quickly manage labels, milestones, assignees, and reviewers. Reviewable keeps this feature text-based (rather than adding extra UI) so you can work entirely from the keyboard, whether you’re using the web app, replying by email, or posting on GitHub. It also leaves a clear, readable record in the comment itself.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>You can apply directives without publishing comments using the <i class="command icon"></i>  text field in the <a href="./reviews#pull-request-details">pull request panel</a> <i class="pull request icon"></i>.</p></div><p>While writing a comment, type a <code>+</code> sign to open an autocomplete menu of available directives. Use the arrow keys to navigate and <code>Tab</code> or <code>Enter</code> to select one. You can also use a <code>-</code> sign to remove a directive after it&#39;s been added.</p><p>Supported directives include:</p><ul><li><strong>+label</strong></li><li><strong>+milestone</strong></li><li><strong>+@username</strong> (for assignees)</li><li><strong>+reviewer:@username</strong> (for requested reviewers)</li></ul><p>Reviewable will warn you if you reference invalid assignees or reviewers — either immediately or via email — but not for labels or milestones, since false positives are common there. If you’re referencing code or variables that look like directives (for example, @user or +dependencies), wrap them in backticks to prevent Reviewable from treating them as inline directives.</p><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">DANGER</p><p>For email and GitHub comments, if the repository isn’t connected, then directives won’t take effect until someone visits the review in Reviewable.

This only works well if you leave all the separators and comment links in place - so be sure not to mangle a quoted message too much in your reply.</p><p>When replying by email, be sure to use interleaved style — placing your responses below the relevant quoted lines (rather than top-posting your entire reply). This helps Reviewable correctly match each comment to its thread.</p><p>Quoted chunks will be shown in Reviewable if they are woven into your reply, but omitted otherwise (whether the message is top- or bottom-quoted). Any parts of the message that can&#39;t be conclusively tied to a specific discussion thread will show up in a top-level discussion instead.</p><p>Reviewable also recognizes a number of case-insensitive shorthands in external comments. You can reply with the single word <strong>acknowledge</strong> (or <strong>ack</strong>) to simulate clicking the primary button in Reviewable (whatever its label might actually be). You can also update the disposition in your reply by inserting on a separate line, by itself, &quot;Discussing&quot;, &quot;Informing&quot;, &quot;Working&quot;, or &quot;Blocking&quot;.</p><p>When replying by email, be sure to separate your comment and disposition with <strong>one blank line</strong>, otherwise GitHub may interpret the disposition as part of the comment text. For example:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>&gt; This looks great.
