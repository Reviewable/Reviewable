Here, you&#39;ll find all open pull requests in which you are a participant. As a participant, these PRs have either been created by you, assigned to you, contain comments from you, or mention you (or a team you belong to). Reviewable automatically updates this list at least once per minute (and data held in Reviewable is updated in real time), so there&#39;s no need to reload the page.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>If PRs appear to be missing from the list, try clicking the <strong>Include stalled pull requests/reviews</strong> link at the bottom of the panel. You may also want to click the green <strong>Also show team reviews</strong> or <strong>Also show private reviews</strong> buttons at the bottom if they&#39;re showing and you haven&#39;t yet granted those permissions. Finally, if PRs are still missing, check whether the relevant organizations have OAuth app access restrictions turned on.</p></div><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="reviewable reviews list"></p><p>PRs are sorted into groups ordered from most to least relevant. Within each group, PRs are sorted in chronological order. The exception is that in the <strong>Waiting on me</strong> group, the PRs that are only waiting on you appear before others; the logic that determines if a PR is waiting on you is described (<a href="./reviews#waiting-on">here</a>). The intention is that the PRs appear in the order you ought to deal with them. You cannot change the sort order, but you can filter the list instead (see below for details).</p><p>You can constrain the list to a specific organization by selecting it from the dropdown menu in the panel&#39;s header. Your selection will be automatically saved for future visits. You can also view all of the PRs in a specific repository by clicking one of the “N open reviews” links on the <a href="./repositories">Repository page</a>, or by entering the full repository name and clicking on the &quot;Go to dashboard for...&quot; link under the query field.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Loading the list of reviews for a single organization or repository will be much faster than doing so for all your repositories.</p></div><p>You can further modify the view with the various toggles and filters on this page. If a specific pull request isn&#39;t showing in the list, you can simply paste its URL into the filter field to access it directly.</p><p>The time since the list of PRs was last updated is displayed under the header. The list refreshes automatically at regular intervals, but you can also force an immediate refresh by reloading the page.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Up to three closed PRs from the previous three days may also be shown here.
