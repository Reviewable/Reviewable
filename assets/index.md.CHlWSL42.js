It&#39;s</p><ul><li><strong>Thorough</strong> — Tracks where par­tic­i­pants stand on each dis­cus­sion, en­sur­ing it won&#39;t dis­ap­pear un­til re­solved. Fully cus­tomiz­able logic de­ter­mines when a re­view is com­plete.</li><li><strong>Efficient</strong> — Clearly shows net deltas since last time you looked, even if com­mits get re­based or amended. Batches com­ments and cor­rectly threads email re­sponses.</li><li><strong>Fo­cused</strong> — Works only with GitHub and GitHub En­ter­prise, mak­ing for a seam­less in­te­gra­tion. Min­i­mal ad­min busy­work, no ex­tra fluff — just awe­some code re­views.</li></ul><p>With Reviewable, you can:</p><ul><li>In­stantly diff any two re­vi­sions of a file, in either a uni­fied or side-by-side view.</li><li>Hide mi­nor changes, including white­space, merge, and re­base deltas.</li><li>Map line com­ments across file re­vi­sions and keep them around un­til re­solved, not just un­til changes are pushed.</li><li>Keep track of who re­viewed which re­vi­sion of each file to ensure that no changes are missed.</li><li>Com­bine com­mits for review, or re­view each commit separately.</li><li>Cus­tomize the line length mar­gin, fonts, col­ors, key­board short­cuts, and more.</li><li>Jump from a com­ment straight to the right spot in your fa­vorite ed­i­tor.</li><li>Enjoy a mod­ern, clean UI with a touch of whimsy.</li><li>Get full con­tex­tual help, and fast sup­port if you have ques­tions.</li><li>Sign in with GitHub ac­count — no sep­a­rate ac­counts to man­age.</li><li>Keep all your code on GitHub, not on our servers.</li></ul><p>This user guide is a helpful resource for learning all of the details about every Reviewable feature.

The first steps are fairly straightforward, though:</p><ol><li>Everybody should read through the Registration and Authorization section that follows.</li><li>Then, if Reviewable is already set up for your favorite repos, you can just keep reading straight into the Reviews section that follows and dip into the other sections as needed.</li><li>If, on the other hand, you&#39;re an admin setting up Reviewable for the first time, you&#39;ll want to jump to the Repositories section first for details on how to connect repos and start a subscription (if necessary).</li></ol><p>If at any point you notice a typo or mistake, please don&#39;t hesitate to jump in and propose an edit via the link in the top right corner of every page.</p><h2 id="help-on-using-reviewable" tabindex="-1">Help on using Reviewable <a class="header-anchor" href="#help-on-using-reviewable" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Help on using Reviewable&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Help is available through many channels:</p><ul><li>X-Ray: Press <code>F1</code> or <code>h</code>, or click <strong>Support &gt; Help</strong>, to view the hints for all of the features on a page. If you invoke help while hovering your mouse pointer over a button or feature, specific help for that feature will appear.
