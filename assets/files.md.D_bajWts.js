The file matrix provides an overview of the files in the pull request, while the individual file areas show diffs and line-specific discussions.</p><h2 id="revision-cells" tabindex="-1">Revision cells <a class="header-anchor" href="#revision-cells" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Revision cells&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A file&#39;s evolution over the course of the pull request is summarized in both the file matrix and the file areas by a row of revision cells. Each cell represents one revision, with the leftmost ⊥ cell being a virtual base revision that changes to match the right diff bound. Colors and icons in the revision cells summarize what happened in the pull request at each revision, as well as the latest review marks.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="reviewable file matrix status" width="300px"></p><p>The brackets in a row are the current left and right diff bounds for the file. To adjust the diff bounds, click on one desired revision bound and drag to the other one.

This enables you to easily remember — and indicate to others — where you left off in the review and easily view only subsequent changes. Marking a file as reviewed doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you think it&#39;s ready for merging, but rather only that you reviewed it at the given revision and added all your comments.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="reviewable fill diffs mark file as reviewed"></p><p>The small button to the left of the file path indicates your current reviewed state for the file at the right diff bound and lets you change it. Typically, as a reviewer, the button will be red to indicate that you need to review this diff, and will turn green when clicked to indicate that you&#39;ve marked the file as reviewed. There are other less common states as well:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;">Color</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="opaque circular inverted red unreviewed icon"></i></td><td>The file has not yet been reviewed at or after the right diff bound.

Click to immediately rescind your review marking.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="opaque circular red-rim unreviewed icon"></i></td><td>The file has not yet been reviewed at or after the right diff bound. Click to mark as reviewed, but marking is not advised because some unreviewed changes are not shown in the current diff, the review is <a href="reviews.md#deferring-a-review">deferred</a>, or you are the author of the PR.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="opaque circular green-rim unreviewed icon"></i></td><td>Reviewed by you or someone else at or after the right diff bound.

The two may not always agree: for example, a file may need your overall review but not at your current diff bounds, or a file may have been sufficiently reviewed but you set your <a href="./reviews#file-review-type">review overlap strategy</a> to personally review all files.</p><p>The various possible states are:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;">State</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="red designation you icon"></i> </td><td>Your review of this file has been requested, either directly or due to team membership, and you have not yet reviewed it at the latest revision.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="red designation anyone icon"></i> </td><td>Anyone is welcome to review this file, including you.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="designation anyone icon"></i> </td><td>Anyone is welcome to review this file, but you&#39;ve either already done so or are not a reviewer.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="green designation anyone icon"></i> </td><td>Anyone will be welcome to review this file after you&#39;ve published your review.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="designation others icon"></i> </td><td>Specific other people have been requested to review this file, but you either already did so or your review was not requested.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="green designation others icon"></i> </td><td>Specific other people will still need to review this file after you&#39;ve published your review.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="designation done icon"></i> </td><td>The file has been sufficiently reviewed.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><i class="green designation done icon"></i> </td><td>The file will be sufficiently reviewed once you&#39;ve published your review.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Clicking on the state icon will reveal all the details about a file&#39;s current review state: who needs to review it and why, who has already reviewed it, and (when relevant) who reviewed it at revisions prior to the latest one.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="file review state details"></p><p>By default, Reviewable can only tell who has reviewed a file and infer some basic information about who should review it from a <code>CODEOWNERS</code> file, if present. To unlock the full power of this feature — including indicating the scope (e.g., &quot;security&quot; or &quot;accessibility&quot;) of each requested review, when a scope has been satisfied, or whether only specific people&#39;s reviews are needed — you&#39;ll need to <a href="./repositories#designated-reviewers">create designated reviewers</a> in the custom review completion condition.</p><h2 id="file-matrix" tabindex="-1">File matrix <a class="header-anchor" href="#file-matrix" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;File matrix&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Files panel displays a history matrix showing all files and revisions.

They&#39;re organized hierarchically, with files listed before subdirectories at every level. Hover over a nested directory path to see the full path. Obsolete files that once had changes but now have no differences with the target branch are hidden by default, but can be revealed with a switch in the <a href="./reviews#changes-summary">Changes summary box</a>.</p><p>Click the file path to move directly to the diff for that file. Hold down <code>⌘</code>, <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Alt</code> or <code>⇧</code> key (or combinations thereof) when clicking to open the file diff in a new browser tab, on GitHub, or <a href="./accountsettings#external-editor-line-link-template">in your editor</a>.

The header has a corresponding button to mark all files as reviewed (if certain conditions hold — otherwise, a tooltip will tell you why it&#39;s disabled), with an option to undo the action immediately afterwards.</p><p>To the right of the file path you can optionally see reviewer avatars that provide a quick overview of a file&#39;s reviewers. The avatars get progressively more faded out as a user&#39;s review becomes less recent. You can hover over an avatar for details, or click on it to show the diff between that user&#39;s last reviewed revision (for each file) and the latest revision.</p><p>Further to the right is the <a href="#file-review-state">file review state</a> chip that you can click on for full details regarding who has reviewed a file and whether anyone still needs to review it. Chips for fully reviewed files are hidden from the file matrix to reduce visual noise, but will show up on hover.</p><p>Off the right side of the matrix are delta stats for the current diffs, showing lines <span class="text-orange">changed</span>, <span class="text-green">added</span>, and <span class="text-red">deleted</span>. If a file is binary or isn&#39;t currently diffed no delta stats will be shown. The total of all displayed delta stats is displayed overhead, in the lower-right corner of the Changes summary. Other information you may find here includes test coverage statistics and a dropdown with a list of commits included in the current diff bounds.</p><p>The elements above can be turned on or off via a small menu below the file matrix. You can also force all elements to appear when the file matrix is opened as a modal dialog.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="reviewable file matrix options"></p><p>Files can also be grouped, like for the <strong>Tests</strong> group in the screenshot above. You can use this to reorder the file list somewhat (groups are listed alphabetically), and to enable marking a subset of files as reviewed with one click. Reviewable will automatically group some files for you, such as files that were only renamed, that appear in a vendored directory, or that were reverted back out of the pull request. See the section on <a href="./repositories#condition-output">custom review completion conditions</a> for instructions on how to make custom file groups in your repository.</p><h3 id="column-headings" tabindex="-1">Column headings <a class="header-anchor" href="#column-headings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Column headings&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Each column in the matrix represents a single revision of each of the files in the review.
