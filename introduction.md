# Where to find help

## Help on using Reviewable 

Help is available through many channels:

*   Press F1 or the h key to view the hints for all of the features on a page. If you invoke help while hovering your mouse pointer over a button or feature, specific help for that feature will appear.  Press the same key again, or click on the grey background to get back to the app.

*   Click **Support > Issues** to report a bug, or make a feature request. To save effort, please check existing issues for duplicates first if you have a moment.

*   Click **Support > Chatroom** to submit other questions in a public forum.

*   [Send us an email](mailto:support@reviewable.io) for questions that should stay private, or engage in private chat through [Gitter](https://gitter.im/).

## A special note on butterflies

When starting out with Reviewable, butterflies may appear to attract your attention to important features.

If you find them intensely annoying, you can disable the butterflies: open the help overlay with <strong>F1</strong> or <strong>Support > Help</strong>, locate the <strong>Point out new features</strong> toggle in the lower left corner and click it to turn it off.
