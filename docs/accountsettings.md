## Custom diff font

You can customize the font used in all the diffs. The font must be [monospace](https://medium.com/@vilcins/top-monospaced-fonts-for-coding-a7d941a143fe), exactly match the font name, and already exist on your machine. Specify the font size in a CSS format, such as 10pt, 1.2em, or 90%.  If the font can't be loaded Reviewable will fall back on its built-in one.

## Custom stylesheet

You can point to a custom stylesheet that you want to apply to all diffs.  Reviewable uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), so you might prefer to use one of those [predefined styles](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) that can be found in their [styles directory](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles). To use the GitHub style, for example, set the URL to `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.2/styles/github.min.css`.  You can also create [your own styles](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/css-classes-reference.html).

{:.important}
Ensure that the stylesheet is served as text/css. It may be necessary for you to use [https://gitcdn.xyz](https://gitcdn.xyz) or another similar service.

We also have a few extra styles used to highlight tabs, trailing whitespace, and lack of final newline that you can customize:

```css
.tab, .no-newline, .trailing {
  color: #D95C5C;
}

.tab:before {
  content: "\00bb\00a0\00a0\00a0";
}

.no-newline:before {
  content: "\00a0\20e0\23ce";
}
```

By default, only the actual deltas have red/green highlights in two-column mode. If you'd like the whole line to be highlighted as well (like on GitHub) you can add the styles from [this example](https://gist.github.com/pkaminski/2922da3d58f76a8ed7bf), or simply set your account custom stylesheet URL to `https://gitcdn.xyz/cdn/pkaminski/2922da3d58f76a8ed7bf/raw/highlight_lines_in_two_columns.css`.

## Custom line link template

You can specify the URL template for the **line** link that appears in the upper-right corner of discussions. You can use this to open the file in your favorite editor on the specific line that is under review. If there's no template, the default destination is the file's page on Github.

Your editor must support a custom URL scheme for linking to files to use this feature. The sample templates below assume that `/directory/with/repos` is the absolute path to the directory where your git repos live, and also assume that each repo directory is named the same as its repo. Look for your editor below to see the correct entry that you'll need to insert into the field.

* **GitHub:** `https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/blob/{{viewSha}}/{{path}}#L{{viewLine}}` is the built-in default that opens GitHub on the exact version of the file you're looking at with the line highlighted.
* **Visual Studio Code:** `vscode://file/directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}:{{line}}`.
* **TextMate:** `txmt://open?url=file:///directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}&line={{line}}`.
* **Sublime Text:** `subl://open?url=file:///directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}&line={{line}}` if you install an appropriate URL handler.
* **Emacs:** `emacs://open?url=file:///directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}&line={{line}}` if you install the [Emacs URL Handler](https://github.com/typester/emacs-handler) on OS X.
* **Atom:** `atm://open?url=file:///directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}&line={{line}}` if you install the [Atom Handler](https://github.com/WizardOfOgz/atom-handler) on OS X.
* **Eclipse:** `openineclipse://open?url=file:///directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}&line={{line}}` if you install the [OpenInEclipse](https://gist.github.com/uncreative/1100212) script on OS X, or [follow the instructions for Linux](https://gist.github.com/jGleitz/cf9df461698f4e133cef). If you know of solutions for Windows, please [let us know](mailto:support@reviewable.io)!
* **IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, PyCharm, PHPStorm:** `idea://open?file=/directory/with/repos/{{repo}}/{{path}}&line={{line}}` (or replace `idea:` with `pycharm:`, `phpstorm:`, etc.). This should work on OS X, not sure about other platforms.

Use these variables in your custom URL template:

* `{{owner}}`: the repo owner (or organization) username.
* `{{repo}}`: the repo name.
* `{{pr}}`: the pull request number.
* `{{path}}`: the full path to the file (does not start with /).
* `{{sha}}`: the commit sha of the latest revision in this review.
* `{{line}}:` the line number in the latest revision of the file that best represents the original context in which the comment was made.
* `{{viewLine}}`: the line number in the revision in which the discussion currently appears. This is the number that appears in the top-right corner of the discussion.  Not available for code blocks.

Typically, you'll want to edit and load the latest version of the file into the editor, so you probably want to use `{{line}}` rather than `{{viewLine}}`. If you need any other variables for your template, please let us know.

## Custom key bindings

You can customize the key bindings for common commands, and add new ones for commands that aren't bound by default.  First, get a copy of the [default bindings file](https://reviewable.io/bindings.json) and put it somewhere accessible on the web (such as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)). Edit this file according to your preferences; all available commands are given in the file, though not all are bound by default. You can use any key combos supported by [Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice). If your favorite command isn't listed, please [open an issue](https://github.com/reviewable/reviewable/issues) so we can add it.

When you're done, point Reviewable to your custom bindings file by entering its URL in the field. If you're using a gist, make sure to get the “raw” URL, and consider removing the commit SHA from the path to always point to the latest version.

Your bindings will be loaded and applied right away, and the cheatsheet will update accordingly to reflect them. Be sure to check the browser's console if they don't appear to work, since any errors will appear there. To load any updates to your file, either reload the page or make a no-op edit to the URL field.

## Visual tweaks

Click the **Animated transitions** toggle to turn animated transitions on and off throughout the UI.

### Adjust contrast

Use the **Contrast** slider to adjust the UI contrast. Currently this only affects the red and green diff highlighting in reviews, but may be used for other UI elements in the future as well.

## GitHub authorizations granted

This is a read-only list of all the GitHub OAuth scopes you've granted to Reviewable so far.  It can be useful to confirm the extent of permissions granted or when debugging GitHub API issues.
