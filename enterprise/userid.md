### How to find your username or user ID

First, sign in to your GitHub Enterprise instance with the account that you want to become the Reviewable administrator.  (This account doesn't require any special permissions, and in particular doesn't need to be a GitHub admin.)

You can find your username in the top-right account dropdown:

However, please check if you're running GitHub Enterprise in private mode:

![private mode setting](https://github.com/Reviewable/Reviewable/blob/master/enterprise/images/ghe_private_mode.png)

If so, or if you're not sure or think you might switch to private mode in the future, we'll need your numeric user ID instead.  A quick trick to finding that is to check the URL for your avatar image:

Once you've grabbed a copy of the URL, paste it somewhere and find your user ID:

Sorry for the trouble!
