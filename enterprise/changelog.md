Please see the **[integrated SaaS/Enterprise changelog](https://changelog.reviewable.io)**.

Each Enterprise release has a two-part version number (_server.client_) with a corresponding tag on the Docker image.  Note that once you've deployed a given release you'll only be able to deploy releases with version components at least equal to its _min_ version number, which may constrain your rollbacks.

New Enterprise releases are announced on the [reviewable-enterprise-announce mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reviewable-enterprise-announce).
