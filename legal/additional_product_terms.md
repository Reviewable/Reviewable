Version Effective Date: January 1, 2024

When you use Reviewable, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, specific terms for that product or feature may apply in addition to your main agreement with us (the Reviewable [Terms of Service](terms.md), the "Agreement"). Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable Reviewable Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these Reviewable Terms for Additional Products and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

## Competitive Benchmarking

If you offer a product or service competitive to any Reviewable product or service, by using that Reviewable product or service, you agree to and hereby waive any restrictions as to Reviewable on competitive use and benchmark testing in the terms governing your competitive product or service. If you do not intend to waive such restrictions in your terms of use, you are not allowed to use that Reviewable product or service.

## Previews

Previews means software, online services and additional products and features provided for preview, evaluation, demonstration or trial purposes, or pre-release versions of those, such as alpha, beta, or early access. If your Agreement does not include terms and conditions that address Previews, then the following terms apply. Reviewable grants a limited right to use a non-production instance of the Preview. Previews are provided “AS-IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. Reviewable may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. Any information we give you about a private Preview will be considered Reviewable’s confidential information. If you choose to provide comments or suggestions about a Preview, we may use that feedback for any purpose without obligation of any kind. Reviewable’s maximum liability is limited to direct damages up to US $1,000. Reviewable has no obligation to defend, indemnify, or hold you harmless for claims brought by third parties arising from your use of Previews.
