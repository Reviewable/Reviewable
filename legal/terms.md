Effective date: January 1, 2024

These terms of service are entered into by and between you and Ideanest LLC (doing business as Reviewable) (“Reviewable,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). They, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference, govern your access to and use of our Service (defined below), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through our Service, whether as a guest or a registered user.

Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Service. **By using the Service or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service, our [Privacy Policy](./privacy.md), our [Data Processing Agreement](./dpa.md), our [Acceptable Use Policies](./acceptable_use.md), and our [Additional Product Terms](./additional_product_terms.md), incorporated herein by reference.** If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service, you must not access or use the Website.

**THE SECTION BELOW TITLED “ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS REMEDIES” CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT.**


## A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There’s not going to be a test on it, but it’s still useful information.*

1. An “Account” represents your legal relationship with Reviewable. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Reviewable. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the Reviewable [Privacy Policy](privacy.md)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available in our [public repository](https://github.com/Reviewable/Reviewable/tree/master/legal).
3. “Beta Previews” mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.
5. “Reviewable,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Ideanest LLC, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Reviewable, including the Website and any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be over 16 years of age.
8. The “Website” refers to Reviewable’s website located at [reviewable.io](https://reviewable.io/), and all content, services, and products provided by Reviewable at or through the Website. It also refers to Reviewable-owned subdomains of reviewable.io, such as [blog.reviewable.io](https://blog.reviewable.io/) and [docs.reviewable.io](https://docs.reviewable.io/), and other related sites such as reviewableusercontent.io.  Occasionally, websites owned by Reviewable may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *You need to use a GitHub account to access Reviewable; you grant us permission to access GitHub in your name; you must be over 16 years of age; and you may not have more than one Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure. We may disclose that an Organization uses Reviewable.*

### 1. Account Registration
Generally, as a condition of using Reviewable's Service, you are required to create an account with GitHub. Note however, that you may use Reviewable's Service in read-only mode for public data without creating a GitHub account or registering for Reviewable. After creating a GitHub account, you can register with Reviewable by authorizing us to access your GitHub account in your name, and you control the scope of the authority granted to us.  If you lose access to Your GitHub account for any reason, you will lose access to your data and information in Reviewable as well.

### 2. GitHub Access
You represent that you are entitled to grant us access to your GitHub Account, without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable GitHub Account and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting us access to your GitHub account, you understand and agree that we may access and make available any Content that you have provided to your GitHub account (the “Third Party Content”) so that it is available on and through the Service via your account, and we may submit and receive additional information to and from your GitHub account as indicated herein. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all Third Party Content shall be considered to be your Content for purposes of this Agreement. Depending on the privacy settings that you have set in your GitHub account, personal information (as defined in the [Privacy Policy](privacy.md)) that you post to your GitHub account may be available on and through the Service.

### 3. Required Information
Initially, you are only required to share with us your Github account number and the public information associated with it. As you make use of more of Reviewable, you will be required to grant access to other information, such as your email address, repositories, etc.  You can revoke previously granted access at any time in GitHub's [application integration settings](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/7da38b6fb966259af6d5).

### 4. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on Reviewable's Service.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one Account.
- You must be over 16 years of age. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. Reviewable does not target our Service to children aged 16 or under, and we do not permit any Users aged 16 or under on our Service. If we learn of any User aged 16 or under, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#k-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
- You may not use Reviewable in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use Reviewable if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency.

### 5. Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.
- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account. Reviewable cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify Reviewable](mailto:legal@reviewable.io) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your authorization token or Account.

### 6. Publicity
We may disclose the fact that an Organization is a User of Reviewable, and include its name and trademarks in various promotional materials, such as web pages, social media, and private communications. In connection with the foregoing, you hereby grant Reviewable a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual right to use your Organization’s logos and trademarks in any of our marketing and promotional materials solely for the purpose of identifying you as a customer and promoting our business, including but not limited to on our Service.

### 7. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of Reviewable. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Reviewable with its own terms or license agreements; or you may download an application that integrates with Reviewable. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

## C. Acceptable Use
**Short version:** *Reviewable hosts a wide variety of code reviews from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](acceptable_use.md).

## D. User-Generated Content
**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### 2. Reviewable May Remove Content
We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or Reviewable terms or policies.

### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Reviewable Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.6. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Reviewable the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.6. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.

### 4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Reviewable the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant Reviewable the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service.

### 5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including comments, may be viewed by others.

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Reviewable a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Reviewable Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Reviewable as permitted through Reviewable's functionality. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Reviewable Users.

### 6. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Reviewable the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## E. Private Repositories
**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it with your consent or to comply with our legal obligations.*

### 1. Control of Private Repositories
Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories
Reviewable considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. Reviewable will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### 3. Access
Reviewable personnel may only access the content of your private repositories with your express written permission or to comply with our legal obligations. For other private, non-repository data and metadata, we reserve the right to review such information to improve Reviewable.

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example, you may enable various Reviewable services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but Reviewable will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the Reviewable Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

Reviewable will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please [contact us](mailto:legal@reviewable.io) and make sure to include the following:

- a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

### 2. Confidentiality

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered Reviewable’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information.

### 3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to purchase paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [Reviewable Additional Product Terms for Details](additional_product_terms.md).

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us and our affiliates, licensors and service providers, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees, including attorneys’ fees (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or relating to your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, your User Contributions, any use of the Website’s content, services, or products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Service, or your use of any information obtained from the Website, provided that Reviewable (1) gives you written notice within 90 days after obtaining knowledge of any Losses or discovery of facts on which we intend to base a request for indemnification; and (2) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense. You agree to give Reviewable prompt written notice of any proposed settlement of a claim that is indemnifiable under this Section O, and you may not, without Reviewable's prior written consent, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment regarding which indemnification is being sought.

## Q. Changes to These Terms
**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*
